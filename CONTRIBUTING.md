### Ways to contribute

On the GitHub Docs site, you can contribute by clicking the **Make a contribution** button at the bottom of the page to open a pull request for quick fixes like typos, updates, or link fixes.

You can also contribute by creating a local environment or opening a Codespace. For more information, see "[Setting up your environment to work on GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/setting-up-your-environment-to-work-on-github-docs)."

For more complex contributions, please open an issue using the most appropriate [issue template](https://github.com/github/docs/issues/new/choose) to describe the changes you'd like to see.

If you're looking for a way to contribute, you can scan through our [help wanted board](https://github.com/github/docs/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) to find open issues already approved for work.

### And that's it!

If you're having trouble with your GitHub account, contact [Support](https://support.github.com).

That's how you can easily become a member of the GitHub Docs community. :sparkles:
